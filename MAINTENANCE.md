# Marketplace Maintenance & Support Commitment

In accordance with the Mezo veNFT Marketplace Bounty requirements, this document outlines the long-term support and maintenance plan for the platform.

## 📅 Commitment Period
**Start Date:** Mainnet Deployment Date (TBD)
**End Date:** Deployment Date + 6 Months (Minimum)

## 🛠️ Maintenance Scope

### 1. Security & Bug Fixes
- **Critical Patches:** Immediate response and remediation for any security vulnerabilities identified post-launch.
- **Routine Maintenance:** Regular updates to dependencies (Wagmi, Viem, Mezo Passport) to ensure compatibility and security.
- **On-chain Monitoring:** Active monitoring of marketplace activity to detect and respond to any abnormal behavior.

### 2. Technical Support
- **Developer Assistance:** Providing support for developers integrating with the marketplace's smart contracts or APIs.
- **User Support:** Monitoring community channels (Discord/Telegram) to address technical issues reported by users.

### 3. Feature Enhancements (Roadmap)
During the 6-month maintenance period, the following improvements are planned:
- **Advanced Indexing:** Integration of a dedicated subgraph or indexer for faster historical activity lookups.
- **Batch Operations:** Support for listing/buying multiple veNFTs in a single transaction.
- **Governance Integration:** Direct "Vote" buttons on listed veNFTs (where permitted by the underlying veNFT logic).
- **Expanded Analytics:** Historical price charts and volume trends per collection.

### 4. Upgrade Path
- **Smart Contract Upgradability:** While core contracts are non-upgradeable for security, the `MarketplaceAdmin` supports adding new collection adapters should the veNFT standard evolve.
- **Frontend Updates:** Continuous UI/UX refinement based on community feedback.
